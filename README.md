# Heroes Single Page Application (SPA) 

## Summary

In this section, I learned how to create components, how they communicate with each other (@Input and @Output), routing, and, how a service works (client-side), among other things.

This app is a hero wiki where you can see a list of heroes and find them using a search bar.

## For styling I used:

- Boostrap
- Animated.css 

## Note

This project corresponds to the series of activities of the course  "Angular: De cero a experto (Angular 10+)" by Fernando Herrera [link to his page](https://fernando-herrera.com/#/home) at Udemy
